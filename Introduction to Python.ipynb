    "- A *comment* is text following a `#` symbol that is not executed by Python, used to describe and explain the surrounding code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- A *value* is a single unit of data in your code. For example, `12` is an integer value, and `\"hello\"` is a string value\n",
    "- A *statement* is a grammatically sensible piece of code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 12 # A statement.\n",
    "print(x) # Another statement.\n",
    "x+3 # Yet another statement.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- An *expression* is a statement that, when run, evaluates to a single value\n",
    "```python\n",
    "4*(12//3) # An expression that evaluates to the integer 16\n",
    "str(1)+\"+\"+str(2)+\"=\"+str(1+2) # An expression that evaluates to the string \"1+2=3\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- A *variable* is container that associates a single value with a name so that it can be reused\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 19\n",
    "# age is a variable. Its value is an integer\n",
    "```\n",
    "- A *string* is a value representing text\n",
    "- An `int` is a type of numerical value representing positive or negative integers. You can expect Python to perform arithmetic with `int` values exactly\n",
    "- A `float` is a type of numerical value representing real numbers. You should expect any arithmetic you perform with `float` values to give inexact (but reasonably accurate) results\n",
    "- A *function* is an organizational unit of reusable code. Functions are *defined* using a statement starting with the `def` keyword, followed by one or more indented lines of code\n",
    "- - Functions can have zero or more *parameters*. A parameter is a variable whose value is assigned when the function is called.\n",
    "- - Values can be *passed* to a function as input when the function is called. These values are called *arguments*; each argument is assigned to a parameter variable\n",
    "- - A function can *return* a value as output. When the function is called, it evaluates to its return value.\n",

There are two possible values of Boolean type in Python: `True` and `False`. (These are Python keywords, not strings, so you don't need quotes. Capitalization matters.) Three operators are relevant for Boolean values: `and`, `or`, and `not`. These have exactly the meaning you are accustomed to from mathematics class.

Evaluating the `while` loop's condition once again, we have $2^i = 8 < 81 = 3^4$, so the `while` loop's condition again evaluates to `True`, and we again execute the block of code within the while loop, increase the value of $i$ to $4$.
